# Information on the ZeroTier service

ZeroTier allows you to create software defined networks to create a LAN.
This will allow you to connect to computers outside of your LAN if they
are configured on the ZeroTier Lan.

One issue with this is that ZeroTier then has access to your public IP
addresses. Additional research is needed to determine how seriously they
handle privacy.

LearnLinuxTV and Lawrence Systems both have positive reviews.
