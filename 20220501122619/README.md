# May Daily Journal

I've decided that, in an attempt to write more, I will challenge myself
to write a daily diary throughout the month of May.

I'm still deciding if these entries will be public or private. I guess
it may depend on what I'm writing about. Or maybe I'll create a pubic
and a private entry each day and fill it in throughout the day.

Actually, trying to test moving from a public to a private zet and it
seems I can only have one going at a time. That's okay. I'll create the
appropriate zet and edit it as needed throughout the day.
