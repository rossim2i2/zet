# Next Cloud

Wiped the SSD on my raspberry pi last night and installed NextCloud to
back up all my photos on my iPhone. I couldn't get Apache2 working, so I
decided to just start clean. While it took all night, all my photos are
now synced and any new photos should auto-sync.

I also ran into some issues with installing Mosquitto and Node Red on
docker. Well, not installing them, but getting them to communicate with
one another.
