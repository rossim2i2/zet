# New Beats Studio Buds

I've been researching a new set of headphones. The old school wired
headphones work great. However, I get up and move around too much
throughout the day and the wire always gets hung up on something. This
causes either the phone to fall or the ear buds to be ripped out of my
ear.

I have been doing research on what is currently available. My original
AirPods can't last 30 minutes while on a call (although just listening
without the mic have no issues). The Beats Solo 3 were recommended, but
while they are wireless, the are over-the-ear. Not a deal breaker, but I
wanted buds as they seem more "professional". I also gave some serious
consideration to the Samsung Galaxy Pro Buds, but there were mixed
reviews, especially with comfort over long periods of time (I can be on
calls for eight hours straight).

The Beats Studio Buds are new, just released a week or two ago, and
priced at \$150. The reviews online have been mostly positive. It really
was between the AirPod Pro, the Galaxy Pro, and the new Beats. For the
money, I decided to give the Beats a try.

So far I like them. Music sounds great and noise cancellation works
well. The "transparent" mode is weird. It is supposed to be more
"natural" to surrounding sounds. However, it seems to be too "digitized"
and just seems strange.

For meetings, I need to play with noise cancellation and normal mode to
see what sounds best to me and the rest of the participants.
