# Dual boot to PopOS

I love Arch Linux. It's lightweight and highly customizable. I have
learned a ton since switching to it.

However, I'm seeing more and more instances where a tiled window manager
is just causing headaches. I've thought about installing Gnome on Arch,
but had problems last time I tried.

PopOS seems to be highly recommended by a lot of people I follow in the
tech world. I just set up an Arch/PopOS dual boot and will give it a go
for at least a week.
