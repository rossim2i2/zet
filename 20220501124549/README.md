# Created an Ancestry.com Profile

I've been bing watching the show Vikings, loosely based on real Vikings
of the 9th century. I've found myself researching the real people and
comparing and contrasting the written accounts of the real person versus
their depiction on the show.

This got me thinking of my own heritage. I read some reviews about
Ancestry and they were not positive. It seems like there are a ton of
issues with billing and once you stop paying for their service, you no
longer have access to any of the data you've complied.

I did try a free site (can't remember the name), but it didn't have a
huge database of records to review. My father mentioned that his cousin
did a lot of ancestry research so I sent him a message and asked what he
used. Sure enough, Ancestry.com.

While it is expensive, I signed up for six months and started putting my
family tree together. So far, I am impressed. There is a ton of
information out there and I was able to go almost eight generation deep
on my mother's side of the family with little effort.

Looking at some of the documents provided has already answered some
family questions. For example, we knew that we had family killed in
concentration camps during WWII, but didn't know if we had Jewish
ancestry or if we were harboring Jews. End up, my great-grandfather Karl
Vanleer, had "Hebrew" listed as his ethnicity on his immigration papers.
I want to continue digging into my moms side of the family, as our
ancestry there spans all of Europe.
