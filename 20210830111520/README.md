# Functionality to Add to RWXROB's `zet` Command

## `zet rand`

Part of the Zettelkasten philosophy is to consistency go back and review
zet entries. Based on this review, you may find that your thoughts on
the topic have changed, which would lead to either a change in that zet
or a new zet.

The real power though, is that this review may spark ideas and
connections to other zets. If there is a specific topic of interest, a
simple vi magic zet grep can automatically add links to all related
zets. 

This review process and the ability to quickly and easily review
information you have already written is the second half of the
Zettelkasten method.

## `zet counter`

Another idea I had was to add a counter to track the number of times I
review and re-read a zet. I could incorporate this into `zet rand` to
ensure I'm pulling data that has not been reviewed yet. But also, I
could easily put together a "Top 10" list of zets that I keep going back
to.

I think this would be of particular use with my work zet. Especially as
I start a new job, my work zets are going to be very active. I need to
learn an entire companies background, culture and systems.
