# Back to Arch Linux

I couldn't take anymore of PopOS. I really do like the operating system.
However, there were too many issues. The main display wouldn't wake up
from sleep and the mouse lag was horrible.

The mouse lag was really the last straw. It was unusable. I still have a
dual boot, so I may try it again with their next update. The other
option is to install a desktop environment on Arch instead of using
Qtile windows manager.

I'll need to look at the various desktop environments and see which one
I may want to give a try.
