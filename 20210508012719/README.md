# Keeping Caps Lock as ESC

I already created the muscle memory to use Caps lock as the ESC key. And
99% of my time on any NIX system is from my home PC. If I had a job
where I was administering multiple servers, it would make sense to
reprogram myself to use `Ctrl+[`. But for my use case, keeping the
re-mapping makes the most sense.
