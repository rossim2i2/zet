# M&A Integration Handbook - Notes

**Mergers & Acquisitions Integration Handbook**

Helping Companies Realize the Full Value of Acquisitions

By Scott C. Whitaker

## Chapter 1 - Introduction

The tools and templates in the book should be used as guides and for
illustration only. Every integration is different and will need to be
tailored to match its specific needs.

A word to the wise...

* Every integration is the same but different
* Integrations are disruptive
  * Prepare for the worst and expect the best
* Integration is the real work and requires competent people
  * Ask for more staff than you need upfront, and when things get slow,
    you can adjust.
* Have a bias for urgency
  * *The bulk of integration activities should be able to be accomplished
    within a 60 to 120 day time frame.*
  * The longer an integration takes, the more disruptive and expensive
    it can be.
* Overcommunicate
  * Poor communication is the most commonly cited pain point of most
    integrations.

## Chapter 2 - M&A 101 and Assessing Integration Complexity and Risk

All mergers and acquisitions have a common goal...

* They are meant to create synergy that makes the value of the combined
  companies greater than the sum of the two parts.
* *The success of a merger or acquisition depends on whether this
  synergy is achieved.*

### Integration Types

*Subsidiary Bolt-on/Tuck-in*

* Least amount of integration support
* Acquired unit's management team and operations remain largely intact
* Subsidiary manages all integration needs

*Functional Integration*

* Key operating functions (HR, Accounting, Legal) are integrated
* The rest of the business is kept largely intact
* Acquired company's management team is left intact to manage day-to-day
* Establish IMO (Integration Management Office) and process
* 100-day time frame
* Minimal to Moderate Support

*Functional & Operational Integration*

* Typically include senior management changes or restructuring
* Operations and headquarters of the acquired company are destined to be
  moved or closed
* Accounting, Finance, HR & Governance focus
* Establish IMO & process
* Synergy Management Planning
* 100-day time frame
* Moderate to Substantial Support

### Assessing Integration Complexity and Risk

1. Determine what kind of deal is being made early (60-90 days prior to
   close).
1. Assess integration risks and understand their complexity

  * Review Due Diligence Materials
  * Stakeholder Interviews with Key Executives
  * Analysis of Previous Integration Activities (Successes and Failures)

### Due Diligence - Will be covered in Chapter 6

### Stakeholder Interviews and Complexity

The optimal `integration-risk survey` should be created to address the
specific company, industry, and deal type for your integration. Some
universal risk-assessment questions:

* What are the business rationales and the key financial measurements
  that support the deal?
* What are the core business strategies of the newly combined company or
  the acquiring company?
* What are the most sensitive areas of the business that might be prone
  to disruption?
* Are there significant government and/or regulatory challenges for this
  industry (e.g. pharmaceutical integrations)?
* Will some portion or unit of the acquired or merged company be carved
  out and left alone, making extra effort necessary to preserve it
  during the integration?
* What are the time-line expectations for the integration that have been
  communicated to key stakeholder audiences (e.g., the investor
  community)?
* Are major IT system integrations required to realize synergy benefits
  or operational efficiency? What are their expected timing?
* Are there any key executives who might leave as a result of the merger
  or acquisition and create and experience vacuum in a particular area?
* How involved will the integration team bin in synergy work-stream
  tracking and management?
* Are there any Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or union concerns
  that have to be addressed other than the usual ones?
* Are there any past business practices that are incongruent with the
  acquiring company's business strategies (e.g., credit standards for
  new customers)?
* Are there any community issues that will result in a more rigorous
  communication plan being required?

### Stakeholder Interviews and Risk

As an investment manager assesses your personal risk profile before
investing your money, you should do the same to guide your integration
planning.

Some typical questions to get you started:

* What is the overall business environment for the industry of the
  merged companies or the acquired companies?
* Are the newly merged companies within close physical proximity
  (driving distance) or geographically spread out?
* Have the newly merged companies been competitors or did they have a
  manufacturer-supplier relationship?
* How are the executives defining integration, and what are their
  expectations of the degree of effort required to integrate the two
  companies?
* Is the merger or acquisition perceived as a positive development in
  both organizations, or is there resistance somewhere?
* What is the degree of integration expertise in the organization, and
  are there key executives with past integration expertise?
* What are the biggest cultural or change management concerns, and does
  the acquiring company have any experience in these areas?
* Are there other significant business demands and/or financial
  pressures on the organization that have the potential to distract from
  the integration activity?
* Are there significant retention risks for key executives or acquired
  employees? Are there any plans underway to address this?
* Has the senior-executive organizational design been finalized, or has
  a date for when this will be finalized been communicated? Is there a
  target date?
* Is there any significant litigation under way that may affect
  integration planning or timing?

### Operating-Style Risk

Every company operates differently, which effects the way employees
behave and manage the business. While a subjective area, here are some
sample questions:

* How have the two companies traditionally approached the markets they
  serve or operate in? Are they community pillars or more passive in
  their approach to community affairs?
* How are important decisions made in the organization? Is one company
  more top-down and autocratic while the other has more of a bottom-up,
  consensus-building approach?
* How do people advance in each organization? Is there a tried-and-true
  path to the top in one company but another plan in the other company?
* Are the organization structures well-defined in one company and more
  informal in the other?
* Does one company expect the employees to be on-site all of the time
  while the other has a telecommuting policy?
* How is information communicated in each company? Does one company do
  more brown-bag lunches with senior executives while the other does
  webcasts or memos?
* How do connective-tissue functions like HR, finance, and IT differ in
  each organization? Does finance call the shots in one organization
  more than in the other?
* How is spending approved in one company versus the other? Is one more
  liberal on spending limits than the other?
* How do the companies differ in their approaches to decision making?
  Does one company tend to overanalyze while the other is more
  expedient, perhaps relying more on gut experience and intuition than
  on heavy amounts of research and data?
* Does one company have detailed and current information on its consumer
  and/or business-to-business segments while the other has less?
* Does one company have more of a nine-to-five style while the other
  company has more of a norm of working late?

### The Evaluation and Measurement of Performance

How is performance evaluated and measured? While typically a work stream
that is addressed in HR integration planning, understanding the
differences up front can help gain a better understanding of many risk
and complexity factors?

* Is there a standardized performance-management program?
* What is the process for evaluation (direct-line management, 360
  review, peer review, or all of these)?
* How often are the employees evaluated (monthly, quarterly, annually)?
* What are the rewards for exceptional performance? How are they
  administered?
* What are the consequences of poor performance?

Diagnosing significant differences here will help by:

* Providing the integration team with information to help inform and
  shape the overall integration plan and strategy
* Helping the HR integration leaders to understand the challenges of
  integrating the performance-management programs of the two
  organizations.
* Helping the creation of cultural and talent assessment tools.

### Chapter Checklist

Keep these things on your integration checklist:

* Integration Type and Level of Support
  * Determine the Integration Scope
  * Determine the integration Type
  * Estimate the amount of integration support required
* Complexity and Risk
  * Review due diligence documents and assess completeness
  * Complete stakeholder interviews to gauge integration complexity
  * Complete stakeholder interviews to gauge integration risk
  * Assess operating-style risk

## Chapter 3 - Making the Business Case for Integration

### How to Improve Performance

Motivation for M&A is to seek improved financial performance and
shareholder value. Benefits include:

* Synergy
  * Cost Saving and Revenue Enhancement
* Economy of Scale
* Cross-Selling
* Economy of Scope
* Taxation
  * Rarely the primary reason
* Vertical Integration
* Product and Service Diversification

### Measurement of Acquisition Success

* Cash flow
* Quality of new products and services
* Expansion into new markets
* Revenue of the combined entity
* Share price of the combined entity

### The Most Complex Areas

The following areas are typically the most difficult in any merger or
acquisition

* HR Integration
* Salesforce Integration
* IT Integration
* Marketing Communications
* Accounting and Finance
* Most difficult of all is the integration of executive-level leadership

Why do Mergers Fail?

* Conflicting goals and strategies
* Poor communication
* Conflict, conflict, conflict
  * Mainly referring to the new management teams not being able to get
    along and resolve issues.
* Disparate cultures

**Culture clashes make employees anxious and miserable. This is one of
the most important areas to stay on top of in your integration
planning.**

Post-acquisition integration support is often overlooked, underfunded,
or both.

* Organizational integration management should commence immediately
  after day one to get a head of issues.
* A wait-and-see attitude makes you reactive instead of proactive
* Customers will only give about 100 days to iron out any post
  acquisition issues

### Making the Business Case for Integration Support

Overall there is not a good track record.

* Over 75 percent are either disappointing or failures
* 50 percent experience losses of productivity and sales in the first
  eight months
* The majority of managers grade their company's efforts as average or
  poor.
* *Most integrations greatly exceed their time lines or are never
  completed*
* Less than 15 percent of deals produce the expected financial results,
  and nearly 75 percent fail to earn their cost of capital
* 60 percent create no shareholder value at all

Lack of integration makes it worse.

* More than 50 percent of all integration efforts fail to deliver their
  targeted value.
* The majority of the shortfall is attributable to inadequate merger
  integration planning and execution.
* *Many companies have become good at doing deals, but integration
  planning and execution is where value is preserved or eroded.*

Remember the following:

* It's not business as usual
* It's difficult, complex, risky, and often politically charged
* It requires a good plan and a rigorous process, along with some strong
  project management skills to keep things on track
* Sensitivity to the human issue is also required, along with being able
  to identify and escalate unforeseen issues quickly.

Poor integration planning can lead to:

* Too much focus on getting the deal closed instead of making the deal
  work
* Too little focus on operational, cultural, strategic, and
  organizational assessment
* Over reliance on process and tools and avoidance of the tough issues
  such as culture and politics.
* No pre-close planning, which puts an integration in catch-up mode
  right from the start.
* Process driven by activity rather than informed by value preservation,
  synergy realization, and value creation.
* There is no plan for assigning accountability and tracking for
  synergy.

These pitfalls happen for a number of reasons:

* Shortchanging the integration effort
* Lack of appreciation for integration expertise
* Lack of executive "air cover"
* Overoptimistic benefit realization expectations

**An acquisition gives you the potential for creating value in the
combination, but the business benefits are delivered only in the
actual integration.**

Some of the most common poor integration-planning scenarios are:

* Failure to achieve all of the strategic advantages that prompted the
  sponsors to make the deal in the first place, thus wasting the
  resources that have been devoted to the entire acquisition process.
* Integration-execution starts that are sloppy and/or inefficient,
  making it difficult to undo the damage that results.
* A quickly moving competitor who takes advantage of the new
  organization's inability to respond as a cohesive, well-controlled
  entity.
* *Burnout of the best talent int eh newly merged company from being
  woefully overloaded by the integration distractions.*

### Integration Success Factors

Seven common denominators of integration success:

* Communication
* Establishment of a strong executive management team
* Retention of key customers
* Establishment of a shared vision of the future
* Retention of key employees
* Integration of cultures
* Integration of products and services

### Chapter Checklist

Keep these things on your integration checklist:

* The business rational and justification for an integration
* The most common measures of integration success and what integration
  areas are most complex
* Why integrations underperform or fail.
* How to make the business case to get integration support
* The factors for successful integrations

## Chapter 4 - An Introduction to Integration Planning

There are five phases of the integration life cycle.

* Pre-Planning
* Integration Due Diligence
* Integration Office Planning
* Execution
* End State or Wrap-up

### Integration Timing

While planing and integration should be done as quickly as possible,
there are some things that take longer. Factors to consider:

* Operations Consolidations
* Pending Acquisitions
* Information Systems

### Integration and Business Planning

It is always prudent to establish an operating vision to guide and shape
your planning efforts. If you sense the new business strategy lacks
refinement or definition, push back until you get it (if you have the
skills, jump in and help formulate it).

### Vision and Strategy

Key areas that must be well-defined before the integration work gets
under way in earnest:

* Full understanding of the business models of both the new and acquired
  companies
* Senior executive alignment in both companies
* The role of boards and sponsoring organizations in governance
* Operating model principles, as well as functional operating models
  consistent with the overall operating model
* The strategy for the transaction and integration

### Delivering Value (and Not Losing Any)

Here are some of the top areas where integration leaders must contribute
to the bottom line:

* Delivery and implementation of the business plan
* Identification and delivery of synergy plan
* Attainment of quick-win cost-reduction and revenue-enhancement
  initiatives
* A framework for benefit tracking

### Managing the Change, People, and Potential Business Disruption

Integrations by nature are one of the most disruptive business events.
The people side must be factored into your planning:

* A retention plan for top talent and/or sales force employees.
* A customer retention plan.
* Organization design, people selection, and timing for the completed
  organization
* *Clear reporting lines.* Avoid vague or undefined reporting
  relationships, which are a common quick fix in integration that
  seldom work.
* A short-term IMO and supporting resources

### Chapter Checklist

Keep these things on your integration checklist:

* Break down your integration into manageable phases
* Create a timing parameter for each phase after you have considered
  mitigating factors such as operations considerations, IT, and any
  additional acquisition activity your company may be considering.
* Make sure the business strategy is articulated in a manner that can
  inform and enhance your integration planning.
* Evaluate the need for additional integration resources to support your
  activities.

## Chapter 5 - The Pre-Planning Phase

This phase should begin as soon as a deal is imminent and a target
closing date has been set.

### Key Activities

* Determining Integration Type
* Stress Testing and Synergy Assumptions
  * If you have access to the deal information, you can provide feedback
    that can be considered in its terms:
    * Timing
    * Integration Support
    * Synergy Realities
    * Estimated Closing Date

### Reviewing the Planning Documents

Ensure you have access to due diligence documents. Here are some things
to look for:

* Labor (Unions)
* Employee Data
* Store and Plant Data (Not applicable for us)
* Stakeholder Communities or Audiences

### Assessing Potential Challenge Areas

Typical hot spots to consider and questions to ask as you prepare:

* Effective Plan Management Governance
  * What is the right governance structure for the integration plan you
    are implementing?
  * Do you have the capabilities and resources required to execute your
    plan well?
  * Are you prepared to implement your integration plan based on the
    expected day-one timing?
* Delivering Value
  * How can value be delivered with the challenges you are forecasting
    in terms of people, culture, and continuing business?
  * How can you mitigate adverse disruptions in day-to-day operations
    during integration?
  * Are your synergy targets realistic? Is the collective buy-in from
    senior management attainable?
  * What changes may be necessary in the operating model to ensure a
    successful integration?
  * Is the timing for synergy realization realistic?
* Establishing the Right Level of Integration
  * What is the right level of integration to deliver value and attain
    business objectives?
  * What is the recommended pace and timetable for your integration? Is
    it too short or too long when weighed with other considerations? Are
    there integration decisions that have to be delayed for some reason?
  * Do you have the right level of resources (internal and external) to
    manage the integration activity?
* Culture in a Business Environment
  * What are the most prevalent cultural differences between the two
    companies that are integrating? What might happen if the cultural
    differences are not addressed?
  * How much cultural integration work will be required as part of the
    integration's planning and execution?
  * How are you going to manage the sometimes conflicting needs of all
    the stakeholders?
  * *How will you ensure that communication is frequent and relevant and
    adds value to all the stakeholder audiences?*
  * What are the normal pressures of the integration on the culture's
    day-to-day operations?
  * What potentially adverse or disruptive events could threaten normal
    operations during the integration?
  * Are there any political or environmental issues that could distract
    from the integration planning and execution?

A few things that make up an organization's cultural DNA are:

* Behavior
* Functions
* Rules
* Organizational Structure
* Symbols
* History
* Traditions

### Chapter Checklist

Keep these things on your integration checklist:

* Determine the integration type
* Do some stress testing and be aware of synergy assumptions
* Make sure to review the planning documents
* Assess potential challenge areas
* Assess the kinds of cultural changes that are required by your
  integration

## Chapter 6 - The Importance of Due Diligence

Integration leaders need to be highly engaged and preparing for the deal
to close in anticipation of the integration's official starting date.

Key goals in good data collection include:

* Understanding the key aspects of the target company's organization,
  governance, and business processes
* Collecting inputs to support the development of the initial
  integration plan
* Mitigating duplicate data requests to a target company and allowing
  the due diligence team to stay focused on the aspects of a deal's
  closing

### Chapter Checklist

Keep these things on your integration checklist:

* Clarify your data collection goals in preplanning
* Ask only for what you need
* Always protect and safeguard due diligence documents and follow any
  protocols that have been established to protect the security of this
  information.

## Chapter 7 - Establishing an Integration Management Office

An IMO is a temporary project management office that does the following:

* Drives the development of the overall integration plan, including all
  of the integration projects, communications plan, and achievements of
  synergy benefits.
* Defines and manages your integration process, including functional
  work-plan reviews, cross-functional collaborations, *issue management
  plans*, and executive status updates.
* Manages stakeholder communication, including lists of company
  executives, functional resource owners, and acquired company
  management roles.
* Drives the pace of integration.
* Tracks continual improvements, such as measuring and surveying various
  areas and incorporating feedback into updated integration processes
  and tools.

Ideally IMO leaders will have physical office space at both companies
for secure work and collaboration spaces for the duration of the
integration. Most IMO locations can feel like a war room. Having a
dedicates space allows you to collect a materials that have to remain
confidential and secure.

IMO leaders often become sounding boards for issues, problems, and
concerns as employees at acquired companies are experiencing an intense
level of change. At the same time, make sure the IMO office does not
become the complaint department.

Tips for addressing complaint issues:

* Always have an open door, but remind people you are soliciting
  feedback that can help to improve work streams or inform a specific
  solution.
* Avoid discussing personnel issues that are centered on the inability
  of two or more people to work well together, because these complaints
  are usually intended to influence personnel decisions. Personnel
  decisions should be made without any bias and undocumented information
  (i.e., hearsay).
* If an employee raises a personnel issue that may suggest a conduct or
  ethical violation, you should engage your HR contact immediately and
  brief them on the issue.
* Avoid discussions that are centered on an employee's opinion of the
  company's strategy, executive leadership decisions, or any other
  high-level issues. These may be interesting discussions, but the
  employees should be focused on day-to-day operations so as not to
  disrupt the business any more than it is already being disrupted.
* If, despite all of these practices, you have an affected employee who
  is complaining unprofessionally, distracting others, and generally
  counterproductive, address the problem quickly. Disgruntled employees
  are like a cancer in an integration because people are already
  sensitive. Having someone walking the halls with a bad attitude helps
  no one. These are typically people who are on their way out, anyway,
  and if that is actually the case, my recommendation is to execute the
  separation as soon as allowed by your HR guidelines.

### Setting up an IMO

The best IMO for your integration is one that might do the following:

* Establish a formal structure with clear roles and responsibilities
* Leverage the acquiring and acquired company personnel
* Report to a C-level executive
* Have a method established to manage integration information, such as
  project management software SharePoint or Basecamp.

Key reporting elements can include the following:

* The IMO may report to C-suite (typically COO)
* The IMO may include a divisional sponsor if one part of the company is
  heavily involved in the integration (but this is not mandatory)
* An IMO team leader, who may be the executive in charge of the IMO (for
  whom a typical title is vice president IMO)
* An IMO support team, which may include a mix of dedicated staffers,
  consulting resources, and administrative supporting staff.
* Functional  integration team leaders (i.e. HR, IT, Legal, etc.)

*Functional leads are essential to a smooth integration*, and making sure
they understand their roles and responsibilities is critical.

### Setting up an Integration Project Charter

A simple document that clearly outlines the who, what, and how elements
of an integration and to gain commitments from resource owners in
advance.

Having a charter forces you to have tough discussions before integration
activities heat up, so you can resolve difficult conversations in
advance.

``` TODO
Use the template provided on Page 83 to create a Project Charter. There
should be one Project Charter for every project where we sign a LOI.
```

Checklist for Creating an Integration Project Charter:

1. Project title and description, including details on the integration
   of Company ABC into Company XYZ (referred to as Project A in this
   list).
1. Integration Project A purpose, including information on the business
   needs, project justifications, and alignments with strategic plan
1. Integration Project A scope, including planning and management of the
   short-term initiatives required to integrate the merged or acquired
   entity. The scope can be changed through approval of the project
   sponsor and the IMO. (*It is recommended that this line be included
   to prevent the pile-on of operational projects that individual
   stakeholders may like to add to the scope.*)
1. Company XYZ participants for Project A
1. IMO participants for Project A
1. IMO responsibility and authority guidelines, including an outline of
   primary responsibilities of the IMO relative to the project. For
   example:
   * Is the IMO responsible for coordinating a master integration
     schedule and delivery dates for functional plans for Project A?
   * What is the IMO's central decision-making authority for Project A?
1. Integration Project A schedule, including pre-closing to first 100
   days and keeping track of transitioning outstanding items to a
   thinner end-state management process.
1. Integration resources. For example:
   * IMO and project manager roles and stakeholder communication
   * Integration team functions and organizational charts, including
     resource commitments and participation levels.
1. Known stakeholder requirements, including project sponsors,
   functional managers and employees at both the acquired and acquiring
   companies, integration team members and their managers, as well as
   customers, investors, and stakeholders in the community.
1. Functional resources requirements and core responsibilities,
   including the following:
   * Serving as a member of the IMO for division integrations for 60 to
     90 days, on average (time commitment will vary by integration).
   * Developing track and reporting functional work-plan progress and
     issues to the IMO.
   * Ensuring completion and adherence to the scope identified in the
     integration project charter.
   * Planning and coordinating overall activities for their specific
     function.
   * Participating in the IMO integration planning process and using IMO
     tools for tracking and communicating information regarding
     integration activities.
   * Ensuring appropriate links to other functional leaders or
     executives to minimize overlap and to foster efficient coordination
     among functions.
1. Organizational, environmental, and internal and external assumptions
   and constraints - including deal terms that may affect schedule,
   scope, or cost - and resource limitations (e.g., ability, quantity)
   that need to be factored into the plan
1. Integration budget management considerations.

The Project Charter should be reviewed and signed by the project
sponsor, IMO participants, and functional resource owners.

    * Anticipated deal benefit target opportunities (typically available
      with executive approval package for deal)
  * Outputs
    * Initial Synergy Benefit Plan
    * Opportunities requiring further business case analysis and
      planning

Use a template/tool that your organization is familiar with. Important
items to include in your plan are the following:

* A description of the initiative
* Status colors, such as using green, yellow, and red to note where a
  particular part of a project is in terms of the process
* A list of the accountable owners, showing who is responsible for
  completing particular parts of the projects withing each business
  function
* A list of integration leaders or contacts. Depending on the scope of
  a particular part of an organization's involvement, this list may
  assign an individual to manage and be responsible for the status of a
  particular part of the project portfolio within that function
* A targeted completion date
* Dependencies and other team members involved in working on particular
  parts of the integration plan
* Any notes, like those maintained on a weekly basis to provide a view
  of current status and issues and to facilitate cross-functional
  collaborations.
* Some integration plans may require detail on costs as well (sometimes
  called costs to achieve). These are the costs associated specifically
  with an integration work stream (e.g., closing a facility).

### Integration Work Streams

What is an integration work stream? At the highest level, they can
include the following:

* The projects or initiatives that might help you to achieve savings and
  benefits from an integration (e.g., better contracting and labor
  reduction due to duplication of functions).
* The functions that can be integrated to make managing parts of your
  plan easier so you have just one policy and process to oversee (e.g.,
  integrating employee discipline, HR, financial assistance policies,
  and payroll cycles)
* Strategic  alignments and value (e.g., branding, marketing, system
  measurement, and reporting components)
* Any are where two versions of a similar process, policy, or specific
  way of doing business might cause delays or disruptions and limit
  productivity when integrating the two companies

It is important to prioritize work streams:

High
* Projects or initiatives that will achieve savings and benefits from the
  integration
* Any areas where maintaining 2 versions of a similar, process, policy,
  or specific way of doing business will cause disruption and slow our
  evolution to the new company

Medium
* Function that will have to be integrated to make managing easier and
  to have just one policy and process (i.e., employee discipline
  policies, payroll cycles, HR policies, financial assistance policies)
* Any work stream that has strategic alignment and value (i.e.,
  branding, marketing, system measurement, and reporting)

Low
* Anything that doesn't fit into the high or medium categories
* Any work stream longer than 12 months that has no significant HR,
  service level, or operations disruption impacts

### Functional Work-Plan Quality

HR Example:

| Status | Initiative | Owner | Targeted Completion | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| C | Finalize Joe M. consultant agreement | | Completed |
| C | Terminate stock option agreements for Keith R. | | Completed |
| C | New Offer Letters: APA | | Completed |
| C | HR Integration Strategy | | Completed |

The quality and degree of detail in functional work plans can vary
considerably among submissions, dictated by the skills and available
time of the functional resource who is assigned to the IMO.

**Important Tip:** If you are unsatisfied with the level of detail of a
functional work plan; work directly with the owner to layer in the
necessary details and input rather than sending the plan back to the
owners for reworking. A little understanding at the outset goes a long
way, especially if your integration will last for several months.

To be included in the functional work plan:

* Project Timing
  * Is the starting date too late?
  * Are the durations too long?
  * Are the end dates undefined?
* Project Details
  * If there seems to be detail lacking in the integration projects, it
    is best to pause and get the details prior to locking the plans
    down.
* Cross-Functional Dependencies
* Organizational Dependencies
  * Decision rights
  * Organizational structures
  * Staff reductions
  * Cultural integration

### Functions Requiring Extra Attention

* HR
* IT
* Finance
* Corporate Governance
* Marketing
* Facilities
* Legal and insurance
* Operations

### Chapter Checklist

Key areas to focus on:

* Define what you expect to be included in each functional work stream
* Clearly define the timing parameters for integration works streams
* Identify cross-functional dependencies
* Pay careful attention to HR, Finance, and IT work streams

## Planing Your Integration's End State

What is the integration end date? The recommendation for most
integration activities is 90 to 120 days. 

The end state can be defined as:

* The point in the integration at which most of the planned integration
  activities are accomplished
* The transition point, when the IMO process can be ramped down and
  dedicated IMO personnel scaled back or redeployed
* The point at which the remaining open integration work streams and
  issues can be transitioned to functional teams

### How to Know when an Integration is Finished

Focus on the highest-priority areas for your integration and work with
your assigned functional leaders to map out the following for a
particular project by a specified date:

* What is the desired experience for the employees and other internal
  stakeholders for this integration project? For example, all employees
  will have a commonly formatted e-mail address, all employees will have
  access to the common intranet site, and all legacy intranet sites will
  be "sunseted"
* What is the desired end state for our customers? For example, all
  customers will have access to the full array of newco products and
  services, and pricing will be uniform throughout our distribution
  footprint.
* What is the desired end state for the community? For example, our
  legacy community outreach and charitable programs will be
  consolidated, and we will speak to the communities we operate it in
  the unified voice of our new company.
* What is the desired end state for marketing? For example, we will
  market under our newco brand name and logo in all the markets we
  serve.

### The Typical Process: Roles, Responsibilities, Tracking, and Finishing Well

At the conclusion of the IMO oversight of the integration management
process, outstanding work-plan elements should be collected, organized
by function, and formally transferred to that function.

The IMO should facilitate a weekly end state call with all functions for
30 days following day 100. At day 130, any remaining end state issues
are formally documented, and IMO involvement concludes.

Pay attention to end state work streams and make sure they are handed off
so the new owner has the following:

* Documentation of deadlines and deliverables associated with the
  remaining open items.
* Access to all documentation on the project
* A list of all contacts and stakeholders involved in the project
* A full understanding of what has to be done, by when and by whom. Most
  important, make sure the new owner has an understanding of the
  negative implications of the project getting delayed.

*If the end state hand offs are not processed properly, guess who
typically gets the blame? The IMO!*

End State Work Plan Example

| Description | Role | Accountable for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Integration Manaement Office | Facilies weekly calls and consolidates reporting | Collecting, monitorin progress, expediting completion |
| Functional Resource Owner | Provides functional resource for end state tracking | Ensuring functional resource remains engaged thru end state issue completion |
| Functional Resource/Lead | Monitoring and reporting on end state issue progress and participating in weekly calls | End state issue resolution |
| Acquired Company Functional Resources | May be involved in end state resolution | Assiting functional owner with end state issue resolution |

### Chapter Checklist

A few tips:

* Make sure each initiative is handed off with all previous activity
  (e.g., decks, spreadsheets), so the new organization has all of the
  historical artifacts it needs
* If necessary, articulate end state scenario for high-priority projects
* Meet with the senior leadership of any functions receiving end state
  issues, to review, discuss, and recommend action and to confirm the
  official hand off
* Provide the functional personnel with any contact information for the
  integration team in case there are questions down the road that need
  clarifications

## Chapter 10 - Effective Communication Planning

IMOs struggle with communication the most due to:

* Information itself is closely guarded or unavailable, so meaningful
  content becomes hared to get in the first place.
* Senior executives do not always buy into sound or frequent
  communication planning, and they disregard pleas for meaningful
  content and news
* Communication is always great when the deal closes and on employee day
  one, but it typically will quickly fade after that

### Communication Planning Objectives

* Define what the employees from both organizations can expect during
  the integration process
* Ensure that the employees understand the integration goals and
  processes
* Provide the employees with an understanding of the new company's
  organizational structure and operational goals
* Reinforce the acquiring company's executives' high level of commitment
  to the integration
* Ensure that the IMO is engaged in all aspects of the integration
  process with ongoing visits to acquired-company locations
* Put safeguards in place to improve the speed of acceptance for change,
  as documented in the employee survey results (Chapter 15)

### Guiding Principals for an Effective Communication Plan

* Frequency, frequency, frequency - err on the side of over communicating
* Honesty
* Specificity of messaging
* Attention to the feedback
* Personalized messages
* Authoritative communications

### Establishing a Communication Matrix

It should include:

* Audience
* Objectives
* Key Messages
* Message Vehicles
* Timing and Frequency
* Ownership
* Draft Responsibility

*Communication Matrix Example*

| Audience | Objectives (Why) | Key Message | Vehicles (How) | Timing/Frequency | Ownership (From Whom) | Draft Responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Employees | | | | | | |
| Customers | | | | | | |
| Suppliers | | | | | | |
| Shareholders/Investors | | | | | | |
| Community | | | | | | |
| Other | | | | | | |

### Don't Just Wing It: Preparing for Employee Day One

Acquired employees are nervous, suspicious, and anxious. This distracts
them from their day to day work. A smooth employee day one is possible
if you:

* Have the right people present. Don't send a middle manager to address
  everyone; make sure the leaders for key functions are present and, if
  possible, set up a webcast to have your CEO address the employees in
  real time.
* Script the entire first day
* Have a plan for continued follow-up ready and in place so you don't
  create a "one and done" communication event (in which the employees
  are treated to a big day one event that soon fades and find them
  clamoring for more information).
* Collect questions and create a rolling FAQ log, a list of frequently
  asked questions with answers that can be updated each week as new
  questions are asked. This way you have a resource you can send people
  who need answers, or you can direct them to a shared site where the
  FAQ documents can always be found.

### The Risk of Poor Communications

* Culture War
* Customer defections
* Rogue planning efforts
* Stalled productivity
* Unexpected costs
* Poor morale

### A Proper Communication Process

A good communication process should include the following:

* Ensuring that the CMP guiding principles and objectives are in force
  and that complete and consistent messages are delivered.
* Collaborating with functions on the day 0 content preparation schedule
  (the IMO may ghostwrite communications as needed)
* Collaborating with HR and the project sponsor to finalize day 0
  content and materials
* Doing a day 0 and employee day 1 communication readiness review (e.g.,
  content ready, message order, delivery vehicle, messengers or proxies,
  confirmations).
* Receiving status updates through the IMO weekly process when
  communication has taken place in each function and by executives
* Updating the executive team
* Coordinating tactical responses to any urgent questions that may come
  out of meetings and feedback channels
