# M&A Integration Handbook - Notes

**Mergers & Acquisitions Integration Handbook**

Helping Companies Realize the Full Value of Acquisitions

By Scott C. Whitaker

## Chapter 1 - Introduction

The tools and templates in the book should be used as guides and for
illustration only. Every integration is different and will need to be
tailored to match its specific needs.

A word to the wise...

* Every integration is the same but different
* Integrations are disruptive
  * Prepare for the worst and expect the best
* Integration is the real work and requires competent people
  * Ask for more staff than you need upfront, and when things get slow,
    you can adjust.
* Have a bias for urgency
  * *The bulk of integration activities should be able to be accomplished
    within a 60 to 120 day time frame.*
  * The longer an integration takes, the more disruptive and expensive
    it can be.
* Overcommunicate
  * Poor communication is the most commonly cited pain point of most
    integrations.

## Chapter 2 - M&A 101 and Assessing Integration Complexity and Risk

All mergers and acquisitions have a common goal...

* They are meant to create synergy that makes the value of the combined
  companies greater than the sum of the two parts.
* *The success of a merger or acquisition depends on whether this
  synergy is achieved.*

### Integration Types

*Subsidiary Bolt-on/Tuck-in*

* Least amount of integration support
* Acquired unit's management team and operations remain largely intact
* Subsidiary manages all integration needs

*Functional Integration*

* Key operating functions (HR, Accounting, Legal) are integrated
* The rest of the business is kept largely intact
* Acquired company's management team is left intact to manage day-to-day
* Establish IMO (Integration Management Office) and process
* 100-day time frame
* Minimal to Moderate Support

*Functional & Operational Integration*

* Typically include senior management changes or restructuring
* Operations and headquarters of the acquired company are destined to be
  moved or closed
* Accounting, Finance, HR & Governance focus
* Establish IMO & process
* Synergy Management Planning
* 100-day time frame
* Moderate to Substantial Support

### Assessing Integration Complexity and Risk

1. Determine what kind of deal is being made early (60-90 days prior to
   close).
1. Assess integration risks and understand their complexity

  * Review Due Diligence Materials
  * Stakeholder Interviews with Key Executives
  * Analysis of Previous Integration Activities (Successes and Failures)

### Due Diligence - Will be covered in Chapter 6

### Stakeholder Interviews and Complexity

The optimal `integration-risk survey` should be created to address the
specific company, industry, and deal type for your integration. Some
universal risk-assessment questions:

* What are the business rationales and the key financial measurements
  that support the deal?
* What are the core business strategies of the newly combined company or
  the acquiring company?
* What are the most sensitive areas of the business that might be prone
  to disruption?
* Are there significant government and/or regulatory challenges for this
  industry (e.g. pharmaceutical integrations)?
* Will some portion or unit of the acquired or merged company be carved
  out and left alone, making extra effort necessary to preserve it
  during the integration?
* What are the time-line expectations for the integration that have been
  communicated to key stakeholder audiences (e.g., the investor
  community)?
* Are major IT system integrations required to realize synergy benefits
  or operational efficiency? What are their expected timing?
* Are there any key executives who might leave as a result of the merger
  or acquisition and create and experience vacuum in a particular area?
* How involved will the integration team bin in synergy work-stream
  tracking and management?
* Are there any Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or union concerns
  that have to be addressed other than the usual ones?
* Are there any past business practices that are incongruent with the
  acquiring company's business strategies (e.g., credit standards for
  new customers)?
* Are there any community issues that will result in a more rigorous
  communication plan being required?

### Stakeholder Interviews and Risk

As an investment manager assesses your personal risk profile before
investing your money, you should do the same to guide your integration
planning.

Some typical questions to get you started:

* What is the overall business environment for the industry of the
  merged companies or the acquired companies?
* Are the newly merged companies within close physical proximity
  (driving distance) or geographically spread out?
* Have the newly merged companies been competitors or did they have a
  manufacturer-supplier relationship?
* How are the executives defining integration, and what are their
  expectations of the degree of effort required to integrate the two
  companies?
* Is the merger or acquisition perceived as a positive development in
  both organizations, or is there resistance somewhere?
* What is the degree of integration expertise in the organization, and
  are there key executives with past integration expertise?
* What are the biggest cultural or change management concerns, and does
  the acquiring company have any experience in these areas?
* Are there other significant business demands and/or financial
  pressures on the organization that have the potential to distract from
  the integration activity?
* Are there significant retention risks for key executives or acquired
  employees? Are there any plans underway to address this?
* Has the senior-executive organizational design been finalized, or has
  a date for when this will be finalized been communicated? Is there a
  target date?
* Is there any significant litigation under way that may affect
  integration planning or timing?

### Operating-Style Risk

Every company operates differently, which effects the way employees
behave and manage the business. While a subjective area, here are some
sample questions:

* How have the two companies traditionally approached the markets they
  serve or operate in? Are they community pillars or more passive in
  their approach to community affairs?
* How are important decisions made in the organization? Is one company
  more top-down and autocratic while the other has more of a bottom-up,
  consensus-building approach?
* How do people advance in each organization? Is there a tried-and-true
  path to the top in one company but another plan in the other company?
* Are the organization structures well-defined in one company and more
  informal in the other?
* Does one company expect the employees to be on-site all of the time
  while the other has a telecommuting policy?
* How is information communicated in each company? Does one company do
  more brown-bag lunches with senior executives while the other does
  webcasts or memos?
* How do connective-tissue functions like HR, finance, and IT differ in
  each organization? Does finance call the shots in one organization
  more than in the other?
* How is spending approved in one company versus the other? Is one more
  liberal on spending limits than the other?
* How do the companies differ in their approaches to decision making?
  Does one company tend to overanalyze while the other is more
  expedient, perhaps relying more on gut experience and intuition than
  on heavy amounts of research and data?
* Does one company have detailed and current information on its consumer
  and/or business-to-business segments while the other has less?
* Does one company have more of a nine-to-five style while the other
  company has more of a norm of working late?

### The Evaluation and Measurement of Performance

How is performance evaluated and measured? While typically a work stream
that is addressed in HR integration planning, understanding the
differences up front can help gain a better understanding of many risk
and complexity factors?

* Is there a standardized performance-management program?
* What is the process for evaluation (direct-line management, 360
  review, peer review, or all of these)?
* How often are the employees evaluated (monthly, quarterly, annually)?
* What are the rewards for exceptional performance? How are they
  administered?
* What are the consequences of poor performance?

Diagnosing significant differences here will help by:

* Providing the integration team with information to help inform and
  shape the overall integration plan and strategy
* Helping the HR integration leaders to understand the challenges of
  integrating the performance-management programs of the two
  organizations.
* Helping the creation of cultural and talent assessment tools.

### How to Improve Performance

Motivation for M&A is to seek improved financial performance and
shareholder value. Benefits include:

* Synergy
  * Cost Saving and Revenue Enhancement
* Economy of Scale
* Cross-Selling
* Economy of Scope
* Taxation
  * Rarely the primary reason
* Vertical Integration
* Product and Service Diversification

### Measurement of Acquisition Success

* Cash flow
* Quality of new products and services
* Expansion into new markets
* Revenue of the combined entity
* Share price of the combined entity

### The Most Complex Areas

The following areas are typically the most difficult in any merger or
acquisition

* HR Integration
* Salesforce Integration
* IT Integration
* Marketing Communications
* Accounting and Finance
* Most difficult of all is the integration of executive-level leadership

Why do Mergers Fail?

* Conflicting goals and strategies
* Poor communication
* Conflict, conflict, conflict
  * Mainly referring to the new management teams not being able to get
    along and resolve issues.
* Disparate cultures

**Culture clashes make employees anxious and miserable. This is one of
the most important areas to stay on top of in your integration
planning.**

Post-acquisition integration support is often overlooked, underfunded,
or both.

* Organizational integration management should commence immediately
  after day one to get a head of issues.
* A wait-and-see attitude makes you reactive instead of proactive
* Customers will only give about 100 days to iron out any post
  acquisition issues

### Making the Business Case for Integration Support

Overall there is not a good track record.

* Over 75 percent are either disappointing or failures
* 50 percent experience losses of productivity and sales in the first
  eight months
* The majority of managers grade their company's efforts as average or
  poor.
* *Most integrations greatly exceed their time lines or are never
  completed*
* Less than 15 percent of deals produce the expected financial results,
  and nearly 75 percent fail to earn their cost of capital
* 60 percent create no shareholder value at all

Lack of integration makes it worse.

* More than 50 percent of all integration efforts fail to deliver their
  targeted value.
* The majority of the shortfall is attributable to inadequate merger
  integration planning and execution.
* *Many companies have become good at doing deals, but integration
  planning and execution is where value is preserved or eroded.*

Remember the following:

* It's not business as usual
* It's difficult, complex, risky, and often politically charged
* It requires a good plan and a rigorous process, along with some strong
  project management skills to keep things on track
* Sensitivity to the human issue is also required, along with being able
  to identify and escalate unforeseen issues quickly.

Poor integration planning can lead to:

* Too much focus on getting the deal closed instead of making the deal
  work
* Too little focus on operational, cultural, strategic, and
  organizational assessment
* Over reliance on process and tools and avoidance of the tough issues
  such as culture and politics.
* No pre-close planning, which puts an integration in catch-up mode
  right from the start.
* Process driven by activity rather than informed by value preservation,
  synergy realization, and value creation.
* There is no plan for assigning accountability and tracking for
  synergy.

These pitfalls happen for a number of reasons:

* Shortchanging the integration effort
* Lack of appreciation for integration expertise
* Lack of executive "air cover"
* Overoptimistic benefit realization expectations

**An acquisition gives you the potential for creating value in the
combination, but the business benefits are delivered only in the
actual integration.**

Some of the most common poor integration-planning scenarios are:

* Failure to achieve all of the strategic advantages that prompted the
  sponsors to make the deal in the first place, thus wasting the
  resources that have been devoted to the entire acquisition process.
* Integration-execution starts that are sloppy and/or inefficient,
  making it difficult to undo the damage that results.
* A quickly moving competitor who takes advantage of the new
  organization's inability to respond as a cohesive, well-controlled
  entity.
* *Burnout of the best talent int eh newly merged company from being
  woefully overloaded by the integration distractions.*
