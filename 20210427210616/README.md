# Kitchen Remodel - Day 0 (KR00)

Kitchen is packed up and we are ready to start our kitchen remodel
tomorrow. Everything is boxed up and we will be living off the grill and
paper goods for the next few weeks. Kids are excited to have the kitchen
table in the living room. Hopefully their excitement continues as the
days go on.

As of today, the cabinets are due to arrive May 4th and the appliances
are scheduled for May 6th. I’ll probably use some PTO time to ensure I’m
free when needed as the work is getting done.
