# Milwalkee M18 Tools

I used Jeremy's cordless drill yesterday when putting the bar stools
together. I put the first one together by hand. What a difference the
drill made!

When talking to him today, he stated that he and Lou both really like
the Milwalkee tools. They use these tools daily, and usually drive them
very hard. Milwalkee has a three year warranty and they've used it many
times, without any issues. Report the problem and get sent a new tool.

I just purchased the combo drill/driver and impact driver, as well as an
impact bit set. It comes with two batteries and a charger. While
expensive, it was still cheaper than just purchasing the drill, along
with a battery and charger, from Amazon.

Before making the purchase I checked the garage for the cordless drill I
knew was stored away somewhere. Sure enough, I found it where I put it
10 years ago when we moved in. From the heat of the garage over the
years, the plastic began to melt and everything was sticky.

I threw it out and ordered the new tools. I also brought all my "good"
tools into the house and will eventually put them in an area in the
basement.
