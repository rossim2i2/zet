# Kitchen Remodel - KR01

Day 1 of the Kitchen Remodel officially started yesterday. Jeremy was
able to rip out most of the cabinets and disconnected all the
appliances. He should be back today after lunch to remove the rest of
the cabinets and take the wall down.

Amy put the stove and dishwasher online for sale. Hopefully we can get a
few bucks for them. If not, PC Richards should be able to take them when
the deliver the new appliances.

I should talk to Amy about having them take the refrigerator when the
drop off the new appliances. If needed, we can use the refrigerator in
the basement for a day or two until the new one is installed. It would
save me the trouble of having to move it myself when the kitchen is
finished.
