# Work From Home Setup Improvement Ideas

Looking for items that can augment my work from home experience. There
are cheap portable green screens that I can purchase from amazon and use
with OBS. OBS can then be used as a virtual camera for Webex.

Huion also makes inexpensive writing tablets, which would allow me to
create a virtual white board in OBS.

I have an existing tripod stand that should hold the green screen. The
entire setup may only cost \$100 to implement.
