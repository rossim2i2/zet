# Need to get back into Linux/coding

I've been wasting too much time not being productive, outside of work.
I need to start using some time each morning learning more about `go`
and following up on the latest rwxrob projects. 

I'm also hoping to get WSL2 on my work PC. Although I did write a pretty
cool Windows Batch script to extract 70k files from a folder of 200k+
files. Even though it was a Batch script, it was what I learned via
rwxrob and shell scripting that made it possible.
