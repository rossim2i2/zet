# PfSense is for a Proper Home Network

I spent some more time this morning researching PfSense. I would like to
have my IoT devices on their own VLAN. It was only after a half hour
that I realized that you really need a "proper" home network for this to
work. Meaning a supported router and a supported switch.

Another option is Unify, but that also requires various individual
components (router, switch, access points). 

I still want to look into this, but it may become an expensive setup.
