# I Re-Installed Windows

As much as I love linux, there is just too much it cannot do. For 95% of
what I need, there are no issues. But after spending the better part of
a day just getting a game running on Linux, I ran into a crash 20 hours
into the game, from which there is no recovery.

I will still dual boot Linux and will probably use Linux as my daily
driver. However I'm writing this from Windows, using WSL2.

Plus, it seems that with Win11, we will be able to mount an external
drive to /mnt/home. This would be amazing as I have a drive dedicated to
my linux home mount.
