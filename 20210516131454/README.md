# Updated rwxrob's `zet` script for Issue 25

This is my first attempt at a few things:

1. Updating someone else's code for others to view
1. Working with another Git Branch outside of personal projects.
1. Using a Pull Request

Well the last one didn't happen just yet, I'm researching it now.
However, I'm writing this zet as the final test case to ensure I didn't
break the script.
