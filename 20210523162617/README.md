# Tunz Coral Gum to Cover Aptasia

BSR sells Tunz Coral Gum, which can be used as an epoxy to cover and
kill the aptasia. This brand, in particular, is easy to peel off after
enough time passed.

*Update*: While I have not tried to peel the gum off, this method did
not work at all. The aptasia are sneaky little buggers and the rock is
very porous. They always find new ways of coming back, in greater
quantity.

To help combat it, I recently ordered a file fish and two peppermint
shrimp. The fish is being quarantined right now and I hope to have it
with in the next month.
