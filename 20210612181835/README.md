# Seriously Considering Switching to Android

I've been seriously considering switching from iOS to Android recently.
I've been thinking about making a change for a year or two now, but I'm
actively figuring out ways to make it work in our apple-centric house.

The S21 Ultra is still on backorder, but I think I may pull the trigger
on it, especially with the fact that I can get \$800 trade-in by waiting
and going through Verizon for the upgrade.
