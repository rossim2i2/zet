# Re-installed Windows (Again)

I just re-installed Windows once again. I dual booted my desktop so I
could access a SSD drive that was formatted for Linux. I was able to
retrieve the files I wanted, so the 1 TB drive was basically a
paperweight.

I now have all three drives on a single, fresh Windows 10 installation
(2.5 TB total). One drive will be for Steam games and another for VM
storage. With everything on the cloud now, I won't come close to using
the space I have (I also have two 1 TB external hard drives).

I believe my Ubuntu VM is in a good working position now, so I'll take a
snapshot of it as a fallback. I need to see how I can backup those
images so I don't lose them if I reformat the machine again.
