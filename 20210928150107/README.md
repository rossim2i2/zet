# Universal Yank, Delete, Paste - The UNIX Way

I continue to be amazed at the elegance and simplicity of Rob's (rwxrob)
solutions to everyday problems.

As I'm working, I have Rob's Twitch feed on my second monitor (as I
always do so when co-working). I saw him starting to create a new script
and instantly realized what he was doing.

Anyone who uses `VIM` and especially uses it with multiple `TMUX`
windows/panes, knows how frustrating it is to copy and paste data.
Instead of using VIM buffers or the crazy TMUX copy and paste, just use
a file (`/tmp/buf`) as the buffer.

Rob has a zet on this and the code can be found there or on his (or my)
dotfile repo.
