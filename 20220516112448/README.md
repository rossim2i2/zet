# Bella's Communion

Bella made her communion on Saturday. It was a great party and I had a
good time catching up with family. Its always nice when we are able to
bring both sides of the family together.

My anxiety that day was out of control again though. I took an extra
Klonopin before we left and took another there (I may have taken two
more, I'm not sure). Fight or flight in full effect though.

As always, I was able to get through it, I just hate the feeling.
Especially when it means I would be letting my family down.

One positive is that I drove to and from the church. Although I asked
Amy to drive to the party as I had so many pills and didn't want to
chance it (and, if I'm being honest, didn't want the anxiety to come
back).

The vape seems to help a little, but not nearly enough. I've been taking
a Delta 8 Hybrid, but may need to get a Delta 8 Indica and see how I
feel during the day while I'm on it. The indica is more of a body high
and can make you drowsy. While sativa is more of a head high.

So far I've only ever felt any effects of the vape when taking multiple
heavy hits in a row. But even then, it wasn't a "stoned" feeling.
