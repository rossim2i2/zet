# Coralcruze from NJ Reefers - Positive Purchase Experience

I found coralcruze (Benjamin Weiss) on NJ Reefers and bought some frags
from him. I purchased:
* Octospawn Ultra
* Purple Heart Favia
* Sunkist
* Green Sinularia
* Green Leptoceris (freebie)

It came to \$325 for everything and he shipped on time as promised. I
received everything today and they were packaged safely and arrived in
great condition. In less than 12 hours, they were already expanding and
looking healthy.

I have them on the plugs in the sand bed for now, but will start
deciding where they should be glued down within the tank. Maybe I'll get
around to posting some pictures in one of these zets.
