# Fuck You Skills

I was watching rwxrob's Twitch stream today and the topic changed to
jobs. How long to stay at a job, how you don't owe anything to the
company you are
currently working for, etc.

A lot of his thoughts are similar to mine. Both are loyal, to a fault.
Both are always looking to learn. Both are comfortable with our skill
sets, where we aren't worried about having a job, as we know we'll find
one if we were to be let go or leave our current jobs.

People talk about "Fuck You Money", or even better, "Fuck Me Money",
where you have enough money in the bank where you don't need to work.
I'm not there yet, but that is the goal before I retire (on my own
terms).

However, Rob coined "Fuck You Skills" and I love it. "Fuck You Skills"
are when you know you are marketable and know that you can find another
job at a drop of a hat. Is that cocky? Yes, I suppose. If you flaunt it
and brag about it. If you keep your head down, get shit done, and add
value to the company, knowing in the back of your head you can get
another job at any time, It's not being cocky at all.

I also cannot stress how freeing this is. It removes 80% of your work
stress immediately. If you don't like your boss or the direction of the
company, leave. Or try to make things better, not being afraid to speak
your mind (while staying polite and professional).

Rob's coined a few terms, and this one is up there as one of my
favorites.
