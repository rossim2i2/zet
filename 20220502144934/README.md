# Experience Using Linux VM is Disappointing So Far

After switching back to Windows, I found an old Raspberry Pi that wasn't
being used. So I got a 1TB external hard drive and started to ssh into
that machine. I never had any issues with it either, except I new it was
built with a different infrastructure than a typical computer or laptop.

Watching RWXROB have luck with his VM setup, I decided to give that a
try. At first everything seemed to work great. I set it up with 2 cores
and 4 GB RAM.

However, recently its become so laggy, that its almost unusable. I've
tried connecting from the command prompt, PowerShell, WSL2, and Git
Bash. All give the same poor performance.

I'm seriously considering going back to dual booting Windows and Linux,
but that is a pain in the arse. Instead, I may try to find a cheap PC or
laptop online, install Linux there, and use it to SSH into.

I may actually have an old laptop I can use to do this, but its REALLY
old and needs to be constantly plugged in, and have an Ethernet
connection to work. I forgot the specs, but I think it has four cores
and 4 GB RAM.

As I'm typing this, I can confirm the lag is absolutely unusable and I'm
going back to my Raspbery Pi solution.

Actually, I just killed the pomodoro timer that was running and the
responsiveness improved drastically, although it still lags.
