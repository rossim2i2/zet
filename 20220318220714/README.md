# Using Raspberry Pi as my Linux Terminal

After debating the best way to have a consistent and persistent linux
experience, I dusted off a Raspberry Pi 4 I had collecting dust and
bought a 1TB external hard drive to boot Ubuntu Server off of. 

Everything seems to be working so far. I need to lock down ssh, but also
want to be able to access this device from any computer. Before locking
things down too much, I need to research reverse SSH tunneling more to
determine if that is a viable option for me.
