# Switching from iPhone to Android

My Galaxy S21 Ultra came yesterday and I spent the day getting it set
up. It took a few hours to move all my pictures and videos from my
iPhone to the S21. However, now that I think about it, all the pictures
are already on Google Photos and I am paying for 200GB storage as they
will start contributing photos to your overall storage size.

I still have plenty of room on the phone (256GB) and have been watching
videos and downloading apps to configure everything specifically the way
I want. I'm sure once I go through countless hours of customization,
I'll just go back to the defaults and leave everything there.

Overall I am very happy with the switch so far. Everything is working
and, as most things are in the "cloud" today, just logging onto the apps
I had to download brings over all my settings and data.

The s-Pen came in the mail today. I played with it briefly and there is
a cool coloring book built into the software. I need to do some more
research on what I can/can't do with it now.
