# Remove mapping of `capslock` to `ESC`

I updated my dotfiles to remove the remapping of the `capslock` button
to `esc`. While it makes it much easier when using VIM, the muscle
memory carries over when I'm using another computer that does not have
the mapping (such as my wife's macbook).

`CTRL+[` is another, default, option to use instead of the `ESC` key. I
will start getting used to this combination, as it is universal.
