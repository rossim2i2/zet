# Logs vs. Notes vs. Zets

One of my (many) challenges, has been the differentiation of these entry
types (log, note, zet). I think the lines between notes and zets really
blurs and I'm debating deleting my Notes repo all together now that I
have it migrated to the Zet repo.

For now, I think my main differentiation will be public vs private. My
Zet repo is public, while my log repo is private.
