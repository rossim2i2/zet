# Installing Termux on Android

Termux is a terminal application and Linux environment for Android. The
version available in the Google Play store is deprecated and the
developers advise against using that version.

Instructions on how to install the latest build can be found on their
[GitHub] page.

I used NextCloud to transfer the apk file to the phone, but connecting
the phone to the computer for a file transfer would have also worked.

This gives you a fully functioning terminal on your phone. I was able to
download my dotfiles, connect to git, and use the zet multi-call script.
I'm not sure the use case, but I can even install openssh and connect to
the phone via my PC (assuming the phone is on the same network).
