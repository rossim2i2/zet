# Notes from Niklas Luhmann's Essays

Takeaways regarding a Zettelkasten system:
* Requires addition of randomness
* “Open organization” of notes (not thematically limited)

Requirements (pre PC)
* Wooden boxes, with drawers that can be pulled open
* Paper in octavo format (about half of a letter size sheet)
* Only write on one side of the paper (when searching through them, you
  don’t need to remove the paper to read it)

Functionality
* Every slip is given a number which is easily seen
* Number never changes and always in a fixed place on the slip

Interesting lines:
* Every note is only an element which receives its quality only from the
  network of links and back-links within the system.

On reading and taking notes:
* condensed reformulations on what was just read
