# MGA vs Broker vs Insurer

Managing General Agents are often specialists, working on behalf of an
Insurer. 

Brokers, while also specialists, work on behalf of the policy
holder. 

Wholesalers sell services to other Retail Brokers.

Insurers can perform all the tasks of a MGA. However, as MGAs
are usually smaller and more specialized, they are able to respond to
their clients needs quicker and provide the human touch often missing
from larger carriers.
