GoodReads Review

Designing the Mind is a blend of psychology, self-improvement and systems thinking; explained through the lens of a computer programmer. Ryan Bush does an excellent job of comparing our brain to a computer's hardware, and our mind as the software that operates our brain. He keeps the technical jargon limited and explains the parallels in simple terms. With this high level background, he explains how each event that plays out in our minds is an algorithm. And by noticing these repeating sets of inputs and outputs, we can re-program our minds to correct unwanted behavior and create new habits.

## Introduction

Psychitect 

Psychitecture - practice of designing and optimizing the software of one's mind

## Chapter 1: The Theory and Practice of Psychitecture

### Mind as Machine

"In the past, we humans have learned to control the world outside us, but we had very little control over the world inside us." -Yuval Noah Harari

Analogue for the mind is the computer

- Hardware is the brain - physical substrate made up of neurons, chemicals, and electrical impulses
- Software is the mind - the world of our experinece

Possible to alter your brain to result in functional changes

Transhumanism - modifying the human body, brain, and mind, and taking the evolution of human nature into our own hands.

- "The intellectual and cultural movement that affirms the possibility and desirability of fundamentally improving the human condition through applies reason, especially by developing and making widely available technologies to eliminate age and to greatly enhance human intellectual, physical, and psychological capacities." -Humanity+ Organization

Pshycotechnologies - using thoughts and actions to modify the brain

While people track and optimize their sleep, nutrition and exercise, little is done to optimize the structure of the minds for flourishing

### A New Vision of Enlightenment

"Any man could, if he were so inclined, be the sculptor of his own brain." -Santiago Ramon y Cajal

Even the very belief that our abilities are not fixed can be the determining factor in our success

We can modify and optimize individual functions, features, flaws of our minds a la carte, and this practice, when practiced over time, can lead to algorithmic enlightenment

### Introduction to Psychitecture

Psychitecture is self-directed psychological evolution - the act of deliberately reprogramming your psychological operating system

Process broken into 

- Cognitive - Beliefs and biases, introspection, and wisdom (Perception)
- Emotional - Coping mechanisms, feelings, and desires (Will)
- Behavioral - Actions, temptations, and habits (Action)

### Beginning the Design Process

In order to modify the structure of our minds, we need to observe and analyze their rules and patterns

Metacognition - thinking about your thinking or awareness of your own field of awareness

- lift yourself up out of the system so you can look down on it and begin the process of rewriting

Mindfulness allows us to press pause on our software so we can step in and reprogram it

## Chapter 2: Cognitive Biases and How to Rewire Them

### Cognitive Bias

Cognition is the gatekeeper of virtually every function of our software

Chief cognitive concern is to perceive reality as clearly and accurately as possible

Even when we genuinely want to think and see clearly, our desires and emotions dominate us beneath our awareness

Bad algorithms are called biases - systemic flaws in our thinking

Memories can be fabricated, or even intentionally implanted in another person's mind

### Cognitive Debiasing

"You should take the approach that you're wrong.  Your goal is to be less wrong." -Elon Musk

First you need to familiarize yourself with the most common biases 

Build habits of noticing these situations

Design a better alternative algorithm to the faulty one

Once you have programmed out a certain type of bias in a few different scenarios, the more rational algorithm can become your habitual response.

"Not-knowing is true knowledge.

Presuming to know is a diseaase.

First realize that you are sick;

Then you can move toward health."

-Lao Tzu

### Motivated Bias

Critical thinking skills are not enough to prevent being deeply biased

The tools of rationality are identical to the tools of rationaliztation

### Motivational Debiasing

Second layer of cognitive psychitecture is motivational

Taking stock of desires to hold certain beliefs and the intensity of these desires

All beliefs are just temporary experiments.  Every day is a mental beta test; an opportunity to iterate, expand, and upgrade your cognitive software

You must come to pride yourself, not on the accuracy of your current beliefs, but on your willingness to abandon your beliefs for new, more accurate ones

## Chapter 3: Values and the Methods of Introspection

### Do You Want What You Want?

### Introspection

We are never taught to take our introspective hypotheses as reliable fact without good reason

Introspection can be problematic when done incorrectly

Walking is best for reflection

Take notes when you make a realization

The most important relationship in your life is your relationship with yourself

### Value Intuitions

Evaluative impulses which cause us to feel that certain things fall in a particular place between good and bad

When we identify and arrange them into labeled concepts like "honesty", "compassion" or "discipline", they become values

"The unexamined life is not worth living" -Socrates

### Value Insight

If you or your groups consider an issue to be obvious, ethically simple, and taboo to question, questioning it is exactly what you must do

Your ideal self is a conglomerate of your highest value intuitions and admired qualities

## Chapter 4: Cognitive Self-Mastery and Wisdom

### Decoy Goals

### The Goal Hierarchy

Those who are capable of resisting the temptation of desire and delaying gratification in favor of a more rational choice are more successful and happy in life

### The Dukkha Bias

Desires don't point to happiness, and their gratification is no more likely to result in it than denial

Wanting and enjoying are two entirely separate phenomena

Cravings are decoys to well-being

Dukkha - "unsatisfactoriness"

We are not built to reap real satisfaction from the attainment of our desired goals, but we are built not to notice this fact.

We have to learn to quit trusting our wants as valid indicators of what will genuinely satisfy us

### Defined Goals

When you realize you are pursuing something arbitrary, you have the opportunity to take corrective measures

Desires are the screams you can't ignore, but values are the whispers it is often hard to notice

## Chapter 5: Emotional Algorithms and the Art of Restructuring

### Regulation

The ability to control one's own emotional experience

Emotions often lead us in the opposite direction of your highest goals, cause us to act in ways we later regret, and force us to suffer when there is absolutely no benefit to doing so

You can learn to make the changes in your mind which will allow you to take control of your emotions and feel the way you would like to feel more and more of the time

### Mediation

The cognitive interpretation the mind forms is called an appraisal, and our appraisal of a situation determines our emotional response

Changing our perceptions and changing our desires

You have the poser to choose the interpretation of events

### Reappraisal

The act of reinterpreting the meaning of an emotional stimulus, altering the resulting emotional trajectory.

Over time you can bypass the negative emotion altogether

### Restructuring

By correcting the mistaken reasoning, you can permanently reprogram the algorithm and eliminate the undesired emotion

We choose irrational interpretations and we do it because if feels good

## Chapter 6: Desires and the Keys to Modulating Them

### Changing our Desires

Every desire we harbor is a potential threat to our contentment and stability

Desires that pull us away from our goals are temptations

Desires that push us toward our goals are fuel

"He has the most who is most content with the least." -Diogenes

We don't need to renounce desire altogether; we just need to become proficient desire manipulators

### Modulation Tactics

Learn to increase and decrease particular desires

### Principles of Modulation

Carve out as many alternate paths to your higher goals as you can

Diversification

Design a dense minefield of success for yourself such that it is impossible to take a step without winning

Desire for the future to be different from the present fuels action, but desire for the present to be different from the present breeds nothing but pain

You can learn to desire for the present to be exactly as it is while desiring for the future to be different

## Chapter 7: Emotional Self-Mastery and Equanimity

### On the Pathologies of Philosophers

"Anybody can be angry - that is easy, but to be angry with the right person and to the right degree and at the right time and for the right purpose, and in the right way - that is not within everybody's power and is not easy." -Aristotle

We must all aim to be cognitive realists and emotional optimists

The happiest people, though not necessarily the most comfortable, are shown to be the most productive and motivated

As you learn to exercise a high degree of control over your emotions, the arguments for unhappiness, pessimism, and emotional helplessness will become increasingly baffling to you

Happiness involves experiencing emotions that feel right, whether they feel good or not

### Emotional Algorithms

Our emotions should only be considered useful to us insofar as they serve our personal goals

"The greatest remedy for anger is delay; beg anger to grant you this at the first, not in order that it may pardon the offense, but that it may form a right judgment about it - if it delays, it will come to an end.  Do not attempt to quell it all at once, for its first impulses are fierce; by plucking away its parts we shall remove the whole." -Seneca

Learn to view every frustration you encounter as a test of mental strength, and you will get better and better at maintaining your patience, levity, and control.

The best counter for envy is to shift your perspective, reminding yourself that you are competing only with yourself.

Anxiety - A prolonged and future-oriented version of fear

"Nothing can harm you as much as your own thoughts unguarded." -Siddhartha Gautama

"If the problem can be solved why worry?  If the problem cannot be solved worrying will do you no good." -Shantideva

If you can program your software to remember the futility of worry as soon as it arises, you can gradually eliminate it from your emotional vocabulary

### More Emotional Algorithms

When we fully understand that all things must end, we can learn to appreciate the finite amount of time we have with others and celebrate the end rather than repeatedly mourning the tragedy of impermanence.

### Equanimity

"There is no more reliable proof of greatness than to be in a state where nothing can happen to make you disturbed." -Seneca

Emotional robustness is not getting knocked down in the first place

You have to learn to stabilize your emotions before you can use them proficiently

Resignation to negative emotions is the greatest obstacle to a tranquil mind

i.e. bugs in our software

Equanimity is a state of undisturbed tranquility and psychological stability

## Chapter 8: Self-Direction and Its Impediments

### Craving

A behavioral algorithm is known as a habit

An addiction is any maladaptive behavior which controls an individual rather than being controlled by him

The problem with the modern world is that it optimizes for our drives, not for our values

### Compliance

"He who cannot obey himself will be commanded." -Friedrich Nietzsche

Our behavior varies widely depending on the social forces at play around us

You can program immunity to persuasion and manipulation into your operating system

### Comfort

Comfort can be a powerful sedative which breeds complacency and makes it difficult to do the things we know we should

The decision to let go of comfort and embrace the unknown is met with generous reward

You must build the habit of continually breaking out and expanding your comfort zone 

The mind is made better through stress and discomfort

### Corruption

Our sense of identity shapes the actions we take and the habits we build

This software is the source of our habits.  Unless we take an active role in the programming, who we are and how closely we align to our ideals will be purely a consequence of chance

The reason to act in accordance with your values even when no one is watching is that you are always being watched by the most important person: yourself

## Chapter 9: Behavioral Algorithms and Self-Control

### Behavior, Self-Control, and Willpower

The people with the highest self-control aren't even using willpower

The secrets to self-control and good habits lie in the management and training of these desires

### Input Design

### Consequence Design

The more formal the agreement, the more strongly we will feel the violation

### Goal Design

Extrinsic rewards can not only be weakly motivating, but can actually hurt our motivation and yield inferior work than intrinsic drive

A lack of interest in external rewards appears to be positively correlated with attaining those external rewards

Three properties of intrinsically motivating activities:

- Autonomy
- Mastery
- Purpose

You must be able to see and measure progress in order to stay motivated

## Chapter 10: Self-Mastery

### The Self-Mastery Triad

"You will never have a greater or lesser domination than that over yourself.  The height of a man's success is gauged by his self-mastery." -Leonardo da Vinci

"First there must be order and harmony within your own mind.  Then this order will spread to your family, then to the community, and finally to your entire kingdom.  Only then can you have peace and harmony." -Confucius

When your external world is in chaos, you can place your focus on your internal world.  Let your mind become your sanctuary.  Build a palace of clarity and peace within you that you can visit any time.

### Self-Slavery

The only truly insurmountable barrier to psychitecture is the failure to take on the project at all

### Software Optimization

Reprogramming negative patterns and turning them into positive ones

### Beyond the Human Condition

We live in a world whose fate increasingly falls in the hands of the least wise and most power-obsessed individuals
