# Elephant in the Brain

## Introduction

Many of us have heard the expression, "the elephant in the room."  It
refers to an important issue that everyone is aware of, but no one wants
to acknowledge or address (a social taboo).  In this book, Kevin and
Robin coin "the elephant in the brain" as, "an important but
unacknowledged feature of how our minds work" (an introspective taboo).

### Medicine in Developed Countries

The first example of this phenomenon has to do with the medical
environment in developed countries.  They pose a question, "Why do
patients spend so much on medical care?"  The obvious answer would be to
get healthier.  

However, as they dig into the research, they show that people in
developed countries consume more medicine than required to stay healthy
(doctor visits, drugs, test, etc.).  Studies have shown that people with
free healthcare consume a lot more "medicine" and don't see correlated
results to their overall health.

Studies have also proven the non-medical changes in lifestyle (diet,
sleep, exercise, etc.), have a larger effect on your overall health.
People seem to be more interested in the appearance of good medical care
rather than their overall health.

But why is this?  As they dig deeper, they conclude that medicine isn't
just about health; it is also about conspicuous caring.  About showing
how much you care by going well above and beyond what we require, even
at a direct expense or little to no reward.

### Social Animals

> “Every man alone is sincere. At the entrance of a second person,
> hypocrisy begins.”—Ralph Waldo Emerson

This is not something we consciously observe.  Throughout the book, the
authors cite examples where we subconsciously seek to maximize our
social status (conspicuous caring is really showing others how healthy
you are and how you take your health seriously, as this is a norm in our
society).  

Their thesis is that we are not only capable of acting on hidden
motives; but that we are designed to act on them.  "Our brains are built
to act in our self-interest while at the same time trying hard not to
appear selfish in from of other people."  In order to hide the true
selfish motivations, our brains keep us, our conscious minds in the
dark.  "The less we know of our own ugly motives, the easier it is to
hide them from others."

As social animals, we know that we are always being judged.  Others look
at us and wonder if we would make good friends, allies, lovers, or
leaders.  And they are looking to see why we behave the way we do and if
we are selfish or look out of others.

Since we know we are being judged, we are eager to look good.  We
highlight our "pretty" motives and downplay our "ugly" ones.  And not
just in our actions, but in our thoughts.  "We deceive ourselves the
better to deceive others."

They break the book into two parts.  In Part 1, the authors address why
we hide our motives.  In Part 2, they explore examples of these hidden
motives in everyday life.  

## Why We Hide Our Motives

> “A man always has two reasons for doing anything: a good reason and
> the real reason.”—J. P. Morgan

### Animal Behavior

To help understand why we hide our motives, the authors look to the
animal kingdom.  They go into detail on the chimpanzee social grooming
experience.  This is where the primates groom each other to keep areas
they can't reach themselves clean.

However, studies have found the time spent grooming each other is more
than is necessary to keep their fur clean.  In addition, they spend more
time grooming each other than grooming themselves.  

The accepted reasoning among experts is that social grooming isn't just
about hygiene, but also about forming alliances.  This reasoning would
also explain why social grooming lasts longer in larger groups.

Like humans, chimpanzees may not be aware that there is this underlying
reasoning that goes hand in hand with the hygienic benefits.  

### Competition

Why do redwood trees grow so tall?  Many tree species grow tall to
disperse their seeds more effectively or protect their leaves from
animals looking for a snack, such as a giraffe.  They also grow looking
for additional sunlight.  

With the redwoods, this competition for sunlight creates some of the
tallest trees in the world.  A single redwood, by itself in the forest,
would quickly outgrow the surrounding trees and would not need to spend
additional energy growing even taller.  However, when you have a forest
of redwoods, each tree is competing for sunlight and therefore continues
growing taller and taller, trying to get the fuel it requires to stay
alive.

The human brain is the largest amongst our animal companions.  Our
intelligence is exponentially higher.  If this evolution resulted from
competition with these animals, we would look like a lone redwood in a
forest of smaller trees.

Instead, the social brain hypothesis states human intelligence developed
so quickly because of competition among each other in a variety of
social and political scenarios.  We were competing for sunlight.  There
are instinctual motivating factors in our decision making we are not
always aware of.

### Norms

Today's society has many norms.  There are no laws against cutting in
line, but we frown upon it and judge those that caught in the act.  You
will not be thrown in jail for being loud in a library, but you may be
asked to keep your voice down.  

But why do we follow these norms?  It goes back, like many things, to
our ancient ancestors.  Hunter gatherers had to rely on each other for
food, shelter, and protection.  While one person was out hunting,
another was cooking or building shelter.  If problems arose, the group
would defend each other (there is power in numbers).  

Everyone was an equal and contributed to the good of the whole.  If
someone decided that they no longer wanted to contribute, but still took
advantage of eating the food others caught and sleeping in shelters
others built and maintained, they would throw them out of the group and
left to fend for themselves.  Breaking the norms of that period would be
a death sentence.

Today's norms do not have such dire consequences.  But they do limit
competition amongst ourselves.  Bragging, currying favor, workplace
politics, selfish motives; these are norms in our society that we frown
upon.  However, we still look for ways to subvert them.

### Cheating

While most people do not break or circumvent larger rules (robbery,
arson, murder), we often violate smaller norms (jaywalking, taking
supplies from work, using recreational drugs).  Why do we cheat?
Because it allows us to get all the benefits with none of the typical
costs.

Carly Geehr, a member of the US National Swim team, said, "Nearly 100%
of elite competitive swimmers pee in the pool.  Some deny it, some
proudly embrace it, but everyone does."  Why would they break this norm?
It is too troublesome to take bathroom breaks in the middle of practice.

The human brain has continued to evolve due to this cat-and-mouse game
of cheating and looking for the cheaters.  Our ancient ancestors are
sure to have put a little more food aside for themselves, even though
the risk was getting thrown out of the group.  They found ways to cheat
and not get caught.  Others in the group were more sceptical and found
ways to detect these cheaters.  

So while we know intra-species competition is why our brains and our
intelligence grew and we know norms developed to limit that competition,
this constant cheating and detection competition furthered our
development.

## Hidden Motives in Everyday Life

The second part of this book dives into examples of these hidden motives
in:

- Body Language (non-verbal communication)
- Laughter
- Conversation
- Consumption
- Art
- Charity
- Education
- Medicine
- Relgion
- Politics

I will not write about each of these topics in this review as the
authors even state that you can read Part 2 of the book can in any order
or just those topics that interest you.  They provide a thorough
analysis into each topic, showing examples of how we use each one,
usually subconsciously, and what it subconsciously says to others.

## Conclusion

The Elephant in the Brain provides a unique way of looking at mundane
things we do every day and what we are "saying" to others by those
actions.  It is not a life-changing study, nor does it provide any set
of instruction on how to change our actions.  Instead, it provides a
unique insight into why and how we do them.
