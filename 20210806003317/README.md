# A Brief History of Agile

In 1970 Winston Royce published a paper called Managing the Development
of Large Software Systems where he draws the following graph, which
looks very much like a waterfall going from system requirements,
analysis, coding, testing, and operations.

But before we overly burden Royce too much, immediately after this
graphic he says, "I believe in this concept, but the implementation
described above is risky and invites failure. Required design changes
are likely to be so disruptive that the software requirements upon which
the design is based and which provides the rationale for everything are
violated."

In other words, Royce is saying that cost increases as time goes on, and
this graph really represents that. If the cost of change is exponential
in these systems, then it demands that you have to know exactly what's
happening in the previous step. It has to be accurate. It has to be
validated before going to the next step because as you move through each
step, it gets exponentially more expensive if there is changed required,
whether that is an error or whether that is a change of the
requirements.
