# Use `goc` to Test Go Test Coverage

While watching rwxrob programming `conf-go`, he touched on a script he
wrote, `goc` which will test the percentage of code that is covered by
test (or example) scenarios.

Ideally you would be testing 100% of the code you write, but this is not
always possible or practical.
