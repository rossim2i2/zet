# Organizing To Do Items When Complete

Once again, Rob from rwxrob, came up with a simple solution to a
problem I encountered. I created a simple To Do repo, but wasn't sure
the best (simplest) method to remove items when they are complete.

Why not just create a `done` folder and move them there!
