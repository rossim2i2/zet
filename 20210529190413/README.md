# Created a `fish` Repo to Replace rossiaquariums.com

I found another use this morning for rwxrob's `zet` setup. I received an
email stating that my WordPress hosted site was up for renewal this
morning. As I really haven't been updating that site (nor my main
website), I did not want to continue paying a hosting fee.

Instead, I just created a `fish` repository and moved my blog entries to
the corresponding `README.md` files. This was my first `zet` use case
where I put something other than the `README.md` file in the `zet`
folder. I saved the images on the blog in the same folder.

This will allow me to easily create a free, static website based on the
git repo. It also gives me an easy way to continue adding "blog"
entries. I haven't documented the tank since last October and am
approaching it's one year anniversary.

To make the necessary isosec folders, I created a quick throw-away
script and manually put the isosec value based on the timestamp of the
blog entry. This allowed me to keep the `zet` folder structure, while
providing easy integration and expansion.
