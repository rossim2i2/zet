# Finally a Place to Keep my Thoughts

I've always struggled with finding the right location to keep notes,
thoughts, ideas, etc. I've tried all the latest fads; specialized
applications, enterprise software (OneNote), Notion.so...

It's funny how it is back to the basics. I've been using simple markdown
files and simple folder structures to organize notes at work over the
past few weeks and it has been working great.

This, now with the Zettelkasten indexing and repo, makes it even easier
to store this data.

I won't be able to use GitHub at work, so I will need to come up with
another solution there.
