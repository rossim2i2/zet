# Ricing Qtile

Now that I'm back on Qtile, I spent some time this morning making it
look a little different. I updated the color scheme and added a
[MRCO](michaelrossi.co) icon.

I also spent some time looking at the `floating` layouts. It is annoying
that you need to use the `super` key to move or resize a window, but it
does work. Hint: For resizing a window, use the right click button.

As I've had no luck the debian or ubuntu based systems (dual monitor
issues and mouse lag that were the deal breakers), I'll stick with Arch.
People give it shit, but it's really not that difficult to install and,
while it does take a bit of a higher skill level, once you have it
setup, "it just works".
