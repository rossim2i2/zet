# Submitted my Two-Weeks Notice to AIG Today

Today I submitted my two-weeks notice to Sam. It was a really difficult
call to make and conversation to have. He has been great to me my entire
time at AIG and we've been through a lot together. I can only hope that
my new manager is as good and as caring as Sam has been.

My last day at AIG will be August 31st and my first day at Venbrook is
September 1st. I'm trying not to second guess or doubt my decision to
leave. The commute to Jersey City was just too much. This is a full time
remote position. And while the pay is not idea, it is still an increase,
with a lot more opportunities for growth.

Amy agrees its the right decision. It sounds like there will be many
late nights. Not just due to the amount of work there is, but also since
most (all but my manager) of the executive team is on the west coast.
Venbrook has assured me that they are flexible though and support a
healthy work and life balance.
