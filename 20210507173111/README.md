# PopOS isn't working well with multi-monitors

There is a lot I like about PopOS so far. However, every time my monitor
turns off and I wake it back up, it does not detect the second (main)
monitor. So far, the only solution is restarting the machine.

I'll keep looking online for solutions, but this would be a deal breaker
for me and send me back to Arch Linux (maybe with Gnome instead of a
tiling window manager).
