# Tips For Presenting to Executives

These tips are in addition to the presentation saved in Presentations
folder at work.

* Presenting is just as much storytelling as much as engaging your
  audience with questions.
* Be confident in what you know and what you don't know.
* Understand the *environment* as much as the *audience*
* Be ready for things to be cancelled at the lat minute and for
  disappointment.
