# OBS and Virtual Cameras

I've been trying to get OBS set up with a virtual camera, which I could
then use for programs like Webex. It would allow me to use OBS and a
`virtual whiteboard` on my Webex meetings.

This is one of the main reasons I moved to Pop OS, as OBS seems to run
better as a floating window, something my tiling window managers are
difficult to get right.

I will keep looking into this and how I can get it working though. I
bought a digital writing pad, which will allow me to take written notes
and drawings and save them digitally (or overlay them on my video).

Hoping there are no driver issues and its plug and play. That is a
project for tomorrow though.
